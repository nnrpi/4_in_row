# 4_in_row

This is a classic "4 in row game", which have a very simple rools: you and your opponent take turns placing your pieces in those spaces in an effort to 
connect four of your own pieces in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally). Originally in this game you use an actual field, so you can place your pieces 
only on the top of the column. Once your piece is placed, you can't move it. You win when you get your line of four, but if no one ends up with a line, the game 
is a tie.
